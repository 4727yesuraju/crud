HOW TO RUN ON LOCALLY : 
          1 . Create a folder as any name.
          2 . Open that folder in any code editor (vs code).
          3 . Open terminal ( ctrl + ~ ) on code editor.
          4 . Type this code to get code locally.
                 git clone   https://github.com/4727yesuraju/crud.git
          5 . Now move to crud folder (cd crud in terminal)
          6 . Ignore client folder.
          7 . Here crud is root folder.
          8 . In root folder create a .env file and create a PORT and CONN_STR
               variables and assign value.
             ex : PORT            =  3000             ( commonly any number between 3000 - 8080).
                   CONN_STR  =  your mongodb_connection_string.
          --- trouble in above process ? : 
               simply paste this code in .env file .
          PORT = 5000              
          CONN_STR =mongodb+srv://4727yesuraju:rough@cluster0.wbclvtg.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
          
          9 . After in terminal (in crud folder as root folder) type this command to run server.
                      npm i                        (installing all  dependencies)
                      npm run dev         (to run server)
          10 . if you get below message in terminal then your server will running successfully.
